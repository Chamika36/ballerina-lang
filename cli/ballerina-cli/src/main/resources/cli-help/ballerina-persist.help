NAME
       bal persist - Manage data persistence

SYNOPSIS
       bal persist <command> [<-h> | <--help>]

DESCRIPTION
       Manage the data persistence in a Ballerina package.

       Initializing the package for persistence is the first step toward achieving
       data persistence in a Ballerina package. This step creates the required
       directories and configuration files. For example:

           $ bal persist init

       Define the application's data model as the next step. Use the generated
       configuration file in the "persist" directory to define the data model
       with the domain-specific entities. Use the standard Ballerina record type
       definitions to represent entities and their relationships. For example:

           type Department record {|
               readonly string deptNo;
               string deptName;
               Employee[] employees;
           |};

           type Employee record {|
               readonly string empNo;
               string firstName;
               string lastName;
               Department department;
           |};

       Then, generate the client API based on the data model. Use the generated
       API to query and manipulate the persistent data in the application.
       For example:

       $ bal persist generate

       Then, create the database if it does not exist and populate it based on the
       data model definition. For example:

       $ bal persist push
